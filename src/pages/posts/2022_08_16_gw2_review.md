It was an absolute kneejerker bloodbath out there this week. Jesus and Kane punished the non-believers, while Mitrovic, Nunez, Zinchenko and Haaland all left their new owners with a bitter taste in their mouth. While it might feel like that FT is burning a hole in your pocket after the first weekend of the season, sometimes the best course of action is to simply do nothing. That extra GW worth of information and extra FT in your pocket for GW3 can make all the difference.

Or at least I hope so, cause I've got a bit of work to do...

### GW2 points - 58
### Overall Rank - 547,392 -> 1,356,117

## Feels Good Man

**James getting away with murder** - 7 points is pretty amazing for someone who probably should have been sent off for multiple professional fouls and somehow got away with an own goal! It's good to know that he doesn't appear to be hampered by starting at RCB. With some tasty upcoming fixtures (lee | LEI | sou | WHU | ful), I have no doubt that he'll have a few more people picking him up over the next few weeks

## Feels Bad Man

**Punished by the template** - They killed me last week and they've done it again this week. Not owning the likes of Cancelo and Martinelli has been absolutely disastrous for my rank. Chances are I'm going to be stubborn and not bother bringing them in now. Only time will tell if that makes my situation worse.

**Nunez** - From my hero in GW1 to my nemesis in GW2. I was so excited to see him start against Palace and even when two big chances went begging, I felt like it was only a matter of time until he scored. We all know what happened next. Joachim Andersen went down like a sack of shite, Nunez got his three match ban and I'll be shipping him out of my team quicker than you can yell "TIMBERRRRRR!"

**Bailey** - Stevie G had nothing but good things to say about Bailey in the lead up to the game against Everton. How he wound up starting on the bench is anyone's guess, but he's on the chopping block for a lot of FPL managers. If a players xMins aren't there, you're taking a big risk by keeping them in your starting lineup.

## The Watchlist

![Pascal Groß](/assets/gross.jpeg)

**Groß (£5.6m)** - A sensible person might go for Martinelli, but I'm already feeling like that bandwagon has left the station. Groß has almost identical underlying stats for £0.6m cheaper. While Arsenal have clearly been enjoying a bit more fortune in front of goal, there's no doubt that Jesus is the main man in that team. Groß has scored all of Brighton's goals so far this season and could have had another against Newcastle!

**Toney (£7.1m)** - Given that most sane people already own Jesus, Toney feels like the most sensible option for managers looking to offload Nunez. The combination of a fantastic run of fixtures for Brentford, his ability to create as well as score goals (1G 2A so far) and being on penalty duties make him a great pick. The fact that he's nearly £2m cheaper than Nunez will also help upgrade other positions on the team.

**Rodrigo (£6.1m)** - Probably not who you expected to be the Golden Boot frontrunner after the first two weeks! Rodrigo has been putting a shift in, bagging three goals with similar underlying stats to Jesus. I like him even more if Bamford is out for any length of time, as he might well take penalties in his absence. I'd like to wait and see how he gets on against Chelsea before pulling the trigger on him.

**Perisic (£5.4m)** - He was on the pitch for 11 minutes against Chelsea and got an assist. It's going to be well worth pouncing on him as soon as he gets regular starts, as there is no denying his quality when getting forward. We watch and wait...

Here's hoping I can turn it around next week and claw my way back inside the top 1 million!
