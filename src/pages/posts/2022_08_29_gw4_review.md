There's a pearl of wisdom that applies perfectly to gameweeks like this:

"A steady knee is worth two in the bush."

Or something like that.

Which basically means, in not so many words, don't get rid of good players with good fixtures just because they've had a bad gameweek or two! If you were one of the hundreds of thousands of people who got rid of Trent, Robbo or Diaz before Liverpool played Bournemouth at home...I don't know what to tell you.

The same can also be said of James and Cucerella, who both came away with attacking returns against Leeds. It just goes to show that a little faith can go a long way.

Not such a good week for cheap midfield darlings Martinelli and Rodrigo though. Unfortunately, you can't buy last weeks points and the managers who brought them in this week will have been left feeling extremely frustrated. No time to gripe about it on Twitter though, GW5 is right around the corner!

GW5 is our first midweek gameweek of the season, with some rotation almost certainly set to ruffle a few feathers. With some clubs also having European football to think about, some players minutes will be carefully managed. The likes of Haaland, Perisic and Martinelli are all highly owned players who are at serious risk of being benched over the next few games. A strong bench could come in very handy for FPL managers.

So how did I get on this week?

### GW4 points: 80pts
### Overall Rank: 1,390,554 -> 588,890

## Feels Good Man

**First green arrow!**

After a tough couple of gameweeks where I drifted around the 1.3 million mark, it feels great to get my first green arrow and more than halve my rank! I'm hoping I can keep this momentum going and push on towards the five digits!

**Groß**

Pascal Groß, and Brighton in general, are looking mighty sharp at the moment. The German has been playing a way more advanced role this season and is getting the goal contributions to show for it! In a week where Martinelli and Rodrigo blanked, having Groß and his 11 point haul made a big difference to my rank.

**Keeping the faith**

While there was certainly a part of me that was tempted to wildcard after a poor couple of gameweeks, I'm pleased that my steady knee was rewarded. Trent, James and Cucurella all rallied this week and combined for a total of 29 points!

## Feels Bad Man

**Salah**

This was a classic case of good decision, bad outcome. If someone said to you that Liverpool were going to win 9-0, I don't believe a single person out there would have bet against Salah to be top scorer this week. While six of his teammates found the back of the net, our mate Mo wasted two big chances! Remember though, the theme of this post is "Keep the faith". A player of Salah's quality is never out of the goals for too long.

I'm very happy with how GW4 went and I'm largely pretty happy with my team. I'm thinking I might use my transfer to upgrade Dewsbury-Hall to somebody a bit more exciting like Eze or Almiron, so that I won't be left feeling too sad when the inevitable rotations start messing with me.
